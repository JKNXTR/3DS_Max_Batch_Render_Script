Stop wasting hours rendering your 3D assets one by one. This free, open-source script for 3ds Max automates the entire process of creating thumbnail libraries. It isolates each object in your scene, renders it, and saves it automatically.

New in Version 1.2:

Sequential Naming: The script now automatically names your output files as "Object 1.jpg", "Object 2.jpg", "Object 3.jpg", etc., keeping your folder organized without manual renaming.

Scene Context Support: You can now define "Always Visible" objects (like a floor plane, backdrop, or scale reference) that will remain visible while the script cycles through your assets.

Key Features:

Batch Processing: Render only selected objects or process all geometry in the scene automatically.

Smart Hiding: Isolates each object instantly for rendering without breaking your scene setup.

Camera Control: Select any camera in your scene to maintain consistent angles across all thumbnails.

Flexible Render Modes: Use your current high-quality render settings (V-Ray, Corona, Arnold) or force a fast 512x512 preview mode.

Scene Safety: The script automatically restores your scene's visibility and selection state exactly as it was before running.

How to Use:

Select Output: Click the browse button to choose the folder where your thumbnails will be saved.

Select Camera: Choose the specific camera angle you want to use from the dropdown list.

Set Context (Optional): Select your ground plane or background objects in the viewport and click "Add Selected". These will now appear in every thumbnail.

Render: Click "Start Batch Render". The script will process the list and save files sequentially as Object 1, Object 2, etc.

Open Source License:

This script is free to use for both personal and commercial projects. You are free to modify and distribute the code.
